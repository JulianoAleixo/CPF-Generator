# CPF-Generator
A CPF generator using JS modules.
This project i made when studing my JS course. I was training the modules concept in JavaScript when i join the CPF validator to a new file that generates a random number to do this CPF generator.

Remind: Do not forget to do the "npm i" in your cmd to install the "node_modules"
